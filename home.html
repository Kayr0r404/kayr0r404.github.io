        My <span class="highlighted-text">Education</span>
    </h1>
    <p>
        I am currently pursuing an Honours degree in Applied Mathematics at the University of South Africa (UNISA),
        which builds upon my academic foundation in mathematical science and strengthens my expertise in solving
        real-world problems using analytical and computational methods. This advanced program allows me to dive deeper
        into complex mathematical models, differential equations, numerical analysis, and applied statisticsâ€”areas that
        Iâ€™m genuinely passionate about. The flexibility of distance learning at UNISA has also helped me develop strong
        self-discipline and time management skills, which are essential for both academic and professional success.
        <br /><br />
        Prior to this, I completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematical Science from Stellenbosch University in
        2023. This was a transformative period in my academic journey. The curriculum covered a wide spectrum of
        subjects in mathematics, statistics, and computer science, providing me with a holistic and rigorous education.
        I learned how to think logically, abstractly, and criticallyâ€”skills that I continue to apply in everything I do.
        <span id="ed__points" style="letter-spacing: 3px; color: rgb(237, 105, 85);"
            onclick="showMore('more__ed', 'ed__points')"> ... see more
        </span>
        <span style="display: none;" id="more__ed">
            <br /><br />
            At Stellenbosch, I took courses in calculus, linear algebra, real analysis, numerical methods, probability,
            and
            statistical theory. These courses didnâ€™t just stay in the classroomâ€”they helped shape the way I approach
            challenges in data, programming, and problem-solving. I also worked with software tools such as R, MATLAB,
            and
            Python, which became integral to my projects and assignments. I enjoyed applying mathematical theory to
            computational simulations and data-driven analysis.<br /><br />

            To supplement my university education with more practical skills, I completed a Data Science Programme with
            Stellitech in 2022. This program focused on real-world applications of data science, covering topics like
            machine learning, data preprocessing, visualization, and the use of Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy,
            and
            Scikit-learn. Through this experience, I became confident in handling datasets, building predictive models,
            and
            drawing insights from data. I also grew to appreciate the importance of storytelling with dataâ€”communicating
            findings in a clear, visually compelling way.<br /><br />

            In addition to my academic pursuits, I took part in the Nedbank Youth Employment Services (YES) program from
            May
            2022 to May 2023. This work experience gave me the chance to apply my skills in a corporate environment. I
            worked with data, created reports in Excel, and collaborated with teams to support business operations. More
            importantly, I learned how to adapt quickly, take initiative, and present ideas clearly to different
            audiences.<br /><br />

            Throughout my academic and professional journey, Iâ€™ve remained committed to continuous learning. Whether
            itâ€™s
            exploring new statistical methods, programming frameworks, or technological tools, I enjoy expanding my
            knowledge base and applying it to real challenges.<br /><br />

            With my Honours degree in progress, I am excited about the opportunities ahead. I see applied mathematics as
            a
            bridge between theory and practiceâ€”between insight and impactâ€”and Iâ€™m determined to use my skills to
            contribute
            meaningfully in fields such as data science, finance, research, or technology.
